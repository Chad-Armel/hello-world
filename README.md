# hello-world
This is my first repository

I have enjoyed coding for fun since my first program on my grandmothers Commodore VIC-20. 
I have always wanted a coding career, but my path took me into the digital radiological informatics field. 
My most recent coding course was a Python course. I have had Java, Javascript, C++, PHP, and SQL experience in college courses,
but have not been able to open a career door into coding to gain the necessary experience to launch a programming career.
I am hoping to gain some experience here by contributing to projects.
